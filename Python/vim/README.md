<h1>How to quit vim</h1>
:wq is two commands (write) and (quit). Which in most cases will likely be what you are trying to do<br/>
<br/>
Why am I telling you this before telling you about vim? Well lets just say it is one of the reasons some people find it uncomfortable, as they edit some code and cannot remember how to save and quit
<br/>
<br/>
If you end up editing your code and do not wish to save it like that, you can simply force quit with :q!

**This only works by the way, provided you are in normal mode**
