<h1> Object Oriented Programming</h1>

<p>These notes may be helpful for introducing some fundamental concepts of OOP</p>

The folders labeled Java and Python will contain the same exercises and tasks. Inside the respective folder there will be an Exercises folder which will contain examples of the worked out tasks. It will be most beneficial for you to only look at these when you are stuck or have completed the task. Be sure to read tasks/exercises carefully as some portions may ask you to run tests that are already built, some may ask you to write your own tests, and some tasks may not involve running code at all.

<h2>Why Java?</h2>
While I may have similar feelings, it does not really matter which Object Oriented Language you use. However having done these exercises in my Fundamentals of Computer Science class, it was clear to me why Java using BlueJ was good for introducing OOP. BlueJ is a simplistic IDE, which is less likely to overwhelm or distract students from the focus of the assignments. It is very intuitive and user friendly to beginning programmers. You write code, you click compile, you click the play button. It is important to not be so heavily reliant on such simplistic features, but the intended purpose of these exercises is understanding OOP, not learning how Java works, or what your compiler is doing, or how to execute code.
<br/>
<h2>Why Python></h2>
Another great question, the simplest answer is because I am more familiar with it and can provide assignments and exercises faster. Like I mentioned in the Java section, you may substitute any OOP language if you prefer or have strong feelings about using Java or Python. The concepts do not change between languages, and that is what is important.
<br/>

<h3>My opinion on doing these exercises</h3>
If you are a beginner, I would follow the directions for installing BlueJ and work through the examples. To really get a good understanding, you should probably repeat the exercises (do everything twice, or maybe even three times)
<br/>
<br/>
Once you have completed the exercises and feel comfortable, I would uninstall BlueJ and get a proper IDE. A quick google search will get you tons of opinions, but if you do not intend to use Java in most of your development work, simply leave it alone. The point was to understand OOP not Java.
<br/>
<br/>
If you already have OOP experience, or have a preferred language that you are trying to become more proficient in.. simply just continue with the exercises in the language of your choosing. If I had not made it clear, the language is of little importance (provided that it is object oriented of course)
<br/>
<br/>
There is however one difference between the Java material and the Python material. Which is that in the python material I strongly encourage the use of <strong>vim</strong>.
<br/>
<br/>
Before you completely lose your mind and run for the hills, I am in no way suggesting that you use vim as your primary text editor. But I do think doingsome simple exercises to get more comfortable using your terminal instead of something like BlueJ or VSCode can be helpful in the future for you.
<br/>
<br/>
The reason I decided to include vim, is because it can help you get more familiar with executing commands from the terminal. With that in mind, I would consider maybe doing the exercises in whatever editor you prefer, and then try repeating them using vim.
<br/>
<br/>
The information about vim and linux/unix commands is extremely narrow. This is very much intentional. The point of this repository is to help students learning OOP.
<br/>

<h2>Getting Started</h2>
Assuming you have read at least some of the information above, go ahead and click the folder for the language you would like to do the exercises in (Java/Python). Each exercise will have a README.md with the necessary information to do an exercise. The Java folder will not include anything about vim or executing commands from your terminal, which is why I would suggest starting there for complete beginners. The Python folder will include a section about vim and some common linux commands that you may or may not need to work through the exercises. By the end of the exercises I hope that you have a better understanding about OOP, and it would be great if you also feel more comfortable writing and executing code from within your terminal.
