<h1> Object Oriented Programming</h1>

<p>These exercises may be helpful for introducing some fundamental concepts of OOP</p>

The folders labeled Java and Python will contain the same exercises and tasks. Inside the respective folder there will be an Exercises folder which will contain examples of the worked out tasks. It will be most beneficial for you to only look at these when you are stuck or have completed the task. Be sure to read tasks/exercises carefully as some portions may ask you to run tests that are already built, some may ask you to write your own tests, and some tasks may not involve running code at all.

Inside the Python Folder, there is also some basic information about using vim. A vary narrow cheatsheet of helpful commands and how to use them are listed. If you feel comfortable completing the exercises for OOP consider using vim to write the necessary code for exercises
